# Yuval Fit OS — Project State

> Central, always-current snapshot of what the app is, how it is wired, and what
> must not be broken. **New agents should read this first**, then
> [`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for how to run, test and extend it.
>
> Last reviewed: **Creator trust card on the signed-out entry screen**. A small,
> static **creator trust card** (`data-creator-card`, titled `יוצר המערכת`) was
> added to `BetaSignInScreen`
> ([`components/access/BetaAuthGate.tsx`](../components/access/BetaAuthGate.tsx)),
> placed **below the privacy/security note and above the privacy/terms links**. It
> introduces who built the system to build trust on the public entry screen:
> *"Fit OS פותחה ומנוהלת על ידי יובל זכאי — מרצה במכללת אורט ומיישם בינה מלאכותית."* +
> *"המערכת נבנתה כדי לעזור לנהל אימונים, תזונה והרגלים בצורה מסודרת, אישית ופרטית."* +
> a faint *"פרטי יצירת קשר יתווספו בהמשך למשתמשים מאושרים בלבד."* It is styled like
> the privacy note (calm `SparkIcon`, `bg-surface-2/60`) so it never competes with
> the Google sign-in card. **PRODUCT DECISION: this public screen shows NO phone
> number, address, WhatsApp link, or contact action** — only name + role + a short
> trust statement; contact details, if ever needed, belong inside the approved-user
> app experience. The card is information-only (no buttons/links). **Unchanged:**
> Google OAuth, guest-disabled/email-hidden states, beta access flow, admin/
> allowed-users/request logic, `BetaWelcomeNotice`, `WelcomeGate`, profile
> onboarding, public pages, schemas/storage/backup. e2e: `auth-entry.spec.ts`
> gained a check that the card is visible with `יובל זכאי` / `מרצה במכללת אורט` /
> `מיישם … בינה מלאכותית` and **no phone number / `tel:` / `wa.me` / whatsapp link**,
> running at both 360px and 390px alongside the existing logo/Google/email/guest/
> legal checks. Validation: `npm run lint` ✓ (changed files clean), `npm run build`
> ✓, `npm run test:e2e` ✓.
>
> Prior: **Auth Entry Polish — Google-only access, locked guest, no top
> clipping**. A **UI-level** change to the signed-out sign-in screen
> ([`components/access/BetaAuthGate.tsx`](../components/access/BetaAuthGate.tsx) →
> `BetaSignInScreen`) that makes the entry cleaner and more intentional, with **no
> change to any auth/gate logic, Supabase config, RLS, the approved-email gate, the
> request-access flow, admin, or guest internals**. Three things changed: (1) the
> **top-clipping** on short mobile heights is fixed — the screen is now an
> `overflow-y-auto` scroll container wrapping a `min-h-full items-center` flex box
> (the standard non-clipping centered-modal pattern), so the brand logo is fully
> visible at **360px and 390px**, content stays centered when it fits and scrolls
> from the very top when taller, with safe-area top/bottom padding and no
> horizontal overflow (the config-notice screen got the same fix). (2) **Google is
> now the only active sign-in method** (`המשך עם Google`); the **email magic-link
> UI is removed from the screen** (no email input, no "שלח קישור כניסה" button) —
> the subtitle is now *"התחבר עם Google כדי להמשיך."* `signInWithEmailLink` stays in
> `lib/beta-access.ts` (unused by the UI, not deleted). (3) **Guest entry is visible
> but LOCKED** — the `המשך כאורח` button renders `disabled` + `aria-disabled` with a
> **`בקרוב`** badge and helper *"כניסה כאורח תהיה זמינה בהמשך. בינתיים אפשר להתחבר
> עם Google."*; it has **no click handler**, so it creates no guest session, writes
> no `localStorage` key, and enters nothing. **Guest infrastructure is untouched and
> dormant**: `lib/guest-session.ts`, `useAppIdentity` guest support, the guest
> banner, the Settings "צא ממצב אורח" action, and the gate's "already a guest →
> open app" branch all remain, so guest entry can be re-enabled by restoring the
> handler. **Unchanged:** Google OAuth behaviour, beta approval/denied/blocked
> flow, `BetaWelcomeNotice`, `WelcomeGate`, profile onboarding, public legal pages
> (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/ai-disclaimer`), all fitness schemas + storage keys.
> e2e: the suite gained a **gate-ENABLED** second build — `scripts/e2e.mjs` now also
> builds with dummy Supabase config into `.next-auth` (`next.config.ts` reads
> `NEXT_DIST_DIR`), served on **:3941**, so the real sign-in screen can be tested.
> New [`e2e/auth-entry.spec.ts`](../e2e/auth-entry.spec.ts) (logo not clipped; no
> horizontal overflow; Google visible+enabled; no email input/button; guest visible
> but disabled/`aria-disabled` with `בקרוב`; clicking guest writes no key + stays on
> the screen; legal links work) runs at **both 360px and 390px** (`auth-360` /

> Earlier: **Workout Recommendation V1 — recommend an existing template
> from the profile**. The first time the saved Personal Training Profile is used
> to *guide* the user (it was previously collect-and-display only). A new

> **never** creates a template or exercises, and **never** mutates anything. New
> pure logic [`lib/workout-recommendation.ts`](../lib/workout-recommendation.ts)

> existing template name + explanation + 2–4 reason chips + primary **"התחל אימון"**
> (existing start-from-template flow, never auto-starts) + secondary **"ערוך

> classes derived from one `variant` prop — `water-celebrate` →
> `water-celebrate-{glow,sweep,badge}`). The three components
> (`WaterGoalCelebrationOverlay`, `ProteinGoalCelebrationOverlay`,

> single shared **counter-based** lock in
> [`lib/use-body-scroll-lock.ts`](../lib/use-body-scroll-lock.ts) (`useBodyScrollLock(active?)`):

> runs on unmount even when navigation fires immediately after a CTA. All six
> overlays now use this hook (the per-component capture/restore effects were
> removed). New e2e `scroll-lock.spec.ts` covers: "לא עכשיו" restores scroll,
> "בוא נתחיל" → `/training-profile` restores scroll, and completing+saving the

> **notes** step stay **optional** (hint "השלב הזה אופציונלי…") — body-related fields
> remain optional by design (sensitive, not needed for recommendations; **no BMI, no
> body-shape labels, no medical/diet logic**). The summary is reachable only when all
> required answers exist; `handleSave` defensively runs `firstMissingRequiredStep`
> and, if anything is missing (e.g. an older profile lacking the now-required
> trainingPreference/guidanceStyle), shows **"חסרות כמה תשובות בסיסיות לפני שמירת
> הפרופיל."** and jumps back to the first missing step — an empty profile can never be
> saved. Per-step and summary "דלג בינתיים" were removed (skip stays only at the
> intro); inside the wizard it's back/next only. Editing an older profile guides the
> user to complete missing required fields with no crash / no data loss. e2e:
> `training-profile.spec.ts` gained required-gate, equipment-≥1, "לא בטוח",

> (1) The entry prompt (`components/profile/ProfileOnboardingPrompt.tsx`) became a

> Prior: Phase 4.2 (**Entry Flow V3 — beta welcome + profile prompt on

## 1. What it is

A personal, mobile-first fitness operating system for one user (Hebrew RTL UI,
English code). It tracks workouts, exercises, nutrition, water and supplements,
plus a small knowledge center. It is a Next.js (App Router) PWA with **no
backend** — all data lives in the browser under `yfos:*` storage keys.

- **UI language:** Hebrew, right-to-left (`<html lang="he" dir="rtl">`).
- **Code language:** English (types, functions, comments).
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` + one `sessionStorage` key. No server, no auth,
  no database, no cloud sync, no AI, no external runtime APIs.
- **Theme:** light / dark only (the old "system" mode was removed in Phase 3.xx
  — the user has full control), applied pre-paint to avoid flashes. See
  [`SETTINGS_CONTROL_CENTER.md`](SETTINGS_CONTROL_CENTER.md).
- **Future direction:** can later be wrapped with Capacitor for a native app and
  surfaced inside a larger "Life OS"; data models are kept clean for that.

## 2. App modules

| Module | Purpose | Key code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Today dashboard | Daily command center: greeting, completion ring, deterministic next-action card, status strip, module cards (workout, macros, water, supplements). Optional-aware (supplements never block the day) | `components/today/TodayView.tsx`, `lib/today.ts`, `docs/TODAY_QUICK_START.md` |
| System Hub ("מרכז מערכת") | Premium `/more` hub gathering all secondary tools into module-coloured categories (pure navigation) | `components/more/SystemHubView.tsx`, `docs/NAVIGATION_SYSTEM_HUB.md` |
| Workouts | Log sessions, build from templates, view history; the active session (builder) is a premium muscle-aware "live workout" experience with an explicit drag-only exercise reorder mode (Pointer-Events drag + keyboard, no data loss) and **collapsible exercise cards** (per-card chevron + `מזער הכל`/`פתח הכל`, visual-only) to tame long sessions | `components/workouts/*`, `docs/ACTIVE_WORKOUT_SESSION_UX.md`, `docs/ACTIVE_WORKOUT_REORDER.md`, `docs/ACTIVE_WORKOUT_COLLAPSIBLE_CARDS.md` |
| Exercise Library | 133 exercises, images, instructions, external demo videos | `components/exercises/*`, `lib/seed-exercises.ts` |
| Nutrition | Daily food logs + macro totals, plus **quick reuse**: an `אכלת לאחרונה` row and per-entry `הוסף שוב` that re-log a previous food in one tap (derived from logs, no new storage). Crossing the **configured protein goal** via any add surface fires an app-wide celebration overlay | `components/nutrition/NutritionView.tsx`, `lib/nutrition-reuse.ts`, `lib/protein-goal-events.ts`, `docs/NUTRITION_QUICK_REUSE.md`, `docs/PROTEIN_GOAL_CELEBRATION.md` |
| Food Library | Visual catalogue of foods to log from | `components/nutrition/FoodLibrary*`, `lib/food-library.ts` |
| Saved Food Values | User's remembered per-food default macros | `docs/NUTRITION_SAVED_VALUES.md` |
| Favorite Foods | Quick-access favorites (identity only, no macros) | `docs/NUTRITION_FAVORITES.md` |
| Water Tracking | Daily hydration log + goal + personal cup/bottle presets, plus a graduated goal-completion / over-goal banner (celebration at 100%, calm amber/rose over-goal states, non-medical wording). Status now colours **every** water surface (Today/Nutrition card, detail hero, gauge) and crossing 100% fires an app-wide celebration overlay from any add surface | `components/water/*`, `lib/water-status.ts`, `lib/water-goal-events.ts`, `docs/WATER_TRACKING.md`, `docs/WATER_PRESETS.md`, `docs/WATER_GOAL_UX_UPGRADE.md`, `docs/WATER_GOAL_GLOBAL_CELEBRATION.md` |
| Supplements Tracker | Personal supplement/medication tracking (no advice); searchable starter-template library with already-tracked state | `components/supplements/*`, `docs/SUPPLEMENTS_TRACKER.md`, `docs/SUPPLEMENTS_LIBRARY_UX.md` |
| Progress | Premium weekly insights screen: weekly hero, rule-based insight cards, 7-day activity trends, human empty states, and personal records — derived purely from existing local data (no AI) | `components/progress/*`, `lib/analytics.ts`, `lib/progress-insights.ts`, `docs/PROGRESS_INSIGHTS_UPGRADE.md` |
| Gym Attendance | Local gym check-in / check-out: prominent Today card, live visit timer, weekly stats (visits, time, avg, last), rich visit history (entry/exit/duration + display-only linked-workout snapshot matched by local day), same-day re-entry guard. Tracks *being at the gym* — separate from workout logging. No GPS | `components/gym/*`, `lib/gym-attendance.ts`, `docs/GYM_CHECK_IN.md` |
| Personal Training Profile | Optional, editable personal profile (goal, location, frequency, experience, duration, equipment multi-select, notes + V2 optional adaptation/age/height/weight/training-preference/guidance-style). Collect + display only — no auto-program, no medical/diet/BMI/body-shape logic. **V3 (UX): the entry prompt is a centered modal and `/training-profile` is a step-by-step wizard** (intro → one question per screen → summary/confirm, progress bar, next/back, save once on finish); an existing profile shows the saved summary and "ערוך פרופיל" reopens the wizard pre-filled. Never blocks the app. localStorage-only; included in Backup/Restore | `components/profile/TrainingProfileView.tsx`, `components/profile/ProfileOnboardingPrompt.tsx`, `lib/personal-profile.ts`, `lib/profile-onboarding.ts`, `lib/app-access.ts`, `docs/PERSONAL_PROFILE_V1.md` |
| Workout Recommendation | Deterministic, local-first, NO-AI layer mapping the personal profile onto **one existing** workout template as a starting point. Scores existing templates on safe signals (goal/location/frequency/duration/experience/equipment/training-preference) using only existing fields; never reads body fields, never creates/mutates a template. Four states (no-profile / incomplete / no-templates / recommendation) on `/workouts` below the command center + a compact link block on the profile summary | `lib/workout-recommendation.ts`, `components/workouts/WorkoutRecommendationCard.tsx`, `docs/WORKOUT_RECOMMENDATION_V1.md` |
| Settings | Premium "control center": appearance (light/dark only), daily goals, water shortcuts, data & storage (incl. a Backup & Restore card), access & privacy, separated sensitive actions, system info | `components/settings/SettingsView.tsx`, `docs/SETTINGS_CONTROL_CENTER.md` |
| Backup & Restore | Local JSON export/import of all Fit OS data: Blob download (+ copy/paste fallback), validated import with counts preview + confirm, last-backup status. No backend/auth/cloud/encryption | `components/backup/BackupView.tsx`, `lib/backup.ts`, `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md` |
| Learn (Knowledge Center) | Card-based Hebrew articles + protein calculator | `app/learn/*`, `lib/knowledge-content.ts`, `lib/protein.ts` |
| Welcome screen | First-visit intro (gate) | `components/welcome/WelcomeGate.tsx`, `lib/welcome.ts` |
| Beta Welcome Notice | Per-session friendly beta greeting after the access gate — shown on every app entry, before the profile prompt (gate) | `components/access/BetaWelcomeNotice.tsx`, `lib/beta-welcome.ts`, `docs/BETA_WELCOME_NOTICE.md` |
| Private Access Notice | _Removed from the active flow_ — superseded by the Beta Welcome Notice; files kept only as a reference | `components/access/PrivateAccessNotice.tsx`, `lib/private-access.ts` |
| Admin Access Code Gate | Client-side access-code gate (not real auth) | `components/access/AdminAccessCodeGate.tsx`, `lib/admin-access.ts`, `docs/ADMIN_ACCESS_GATE.md` |
| PWA | Installable app shell + service worker | `app/manifest.ts`, `components/ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx`, `public/sw.js` |

## 3. Main routes

Generated by the App Router (`app/`). Rendering mode noted from the build:

| Route | Screen | Render |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Today | Static |
| `/workouts` | Workouts | Static |
| `/more` | System Hub ("מרכז מערכת") | Static |
| `/exercises` | Exercise Library | Static |
| `/nutrition` | Nutrition | Static |
| `/nutrition/add` | Add / edit food log | Dynamic |
| `/nutrition/library` | Food Library | Dynamic |
| `/nutrition/water` | Water detail | Static |
| `/nutrition/water/presets` | Edit personal water presets | Static |
| `/nutrition/supplements` | Supplements | Static |
| `/nutrition/supplements/add` | Add / edit supplement | Dynamic |
| `/progress` | Progress | Static |
| `/gym` | Gym Attendance | Static |
| `/training-profile` | Personal Training Profile (step wizard) | Static |
| `/settings` | Settings | Static |
| `/backup` | Backup & Restore | Static |
| `/learn` | Knowledge Center index | Static |
| `/learn/[id]` | Knowledge article | SSG (per article) |
| `/manifest.webmanifest` | PWA manifest | Generated (`app/manifest.ts`) |
| `/icon.png`, `/apple-icon.png` | App icons | Generated |

The bottom navigation (`components/layout/nav-items.ts`) is for daily use and
surfaces five destinations: **Today, Workouts, Nutrition, Progress, More**.
Exercises moved out of the bottom nav into the **System Hub** (`/more`), which
gathers every secondary tool (Exercises, Food Library, Add Food, Water,
Supplements, Learn, Settings, Backup, Lock) into module-coloured categories.
Settings, Learn, Water, Supplements and the add/library routes remain reachable
contextually too. The More tab also lights up on `/exercises`, `/settings`, `/learn`,
and `/gym`. See [`NAVIGATION_SYSTEM_HUB.md`](NAVIGATION_SYSTEM_HUB.md).

## 4. Storage / session keys

All keys are prefixed `yfos:`. **Do not rename or repurpose these keys** —
existing user data is bound to them. See §5 for reset behavior.

### Data keys (localStorage) — owned by `lib/storage.ts` (`STORAGE_KEYS`)

| Key | Purpose | Owner module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yfos:workouts` | Logged workout sessions | Workouts |
| `yfos:foodLogs` | Food logs (all days) | Nutrition |
| `yfos:settings` | App settings **including the theme** (`settings.theme`), the water goal (`waterGoalMl`) and the personal water presets (`waterPresets`) | Settings / Theme / Water |
| `yfos:workout-templates:v1` | Workout templates (starter set shown until first write) | Workouts |
| `yfos:saved-food-values:v1` | Per-food remembered default macros (map by `sourceFoodId`) | Saved Food Values |
| `yfos:favorite-foods:v1` | Favorite food identities (map by `sourceFoodId`) | Favorite Foods |
| `yfos:water-logs:v1` | Daily hydration logs (one record per date) | Water |
| `yfos:supplements:v1` | Supplement catalogue (active + archived) | Supplements |
| `yfos:supplement-logs:v1` | Date-based "taken" marks (≤1 per supplement/day) | Supplements |

### Gate keys (owned outside `STORAGE_KEYS`)

| Key | Type | Purpose | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `yfos:welcome-seen:v1` | localStorage | First-visit welcome screen seen flag (`"1"`) | `lib/welcome.ts` |
| `yfos:beta-welcome-seen-session:v1` | **sessionStorage** | Beta welcome notice seen **this session** (`"1"`) — V3 per-session gate; greets on every app entry after the access gate | `lib/beta-welcome.ts` |
| `yfos:beta-welcome-seen:v1` | localStorage | _Legacy_ permanent beta-welcome flag — retained, **no longer read** (superseded by the session key above in V3) | `lib/beta-welcome.ts` |
| `yfos:private-access-notice-accepted:session` | **sessionStorage** | _Defunct_ — old private-access notice flag, no longer read (notice removed from the flow) | `lib/private-access.ts` |
| `yfos:admin-access-granted:v1` | localStorage | Admin access-code gate unlocked on this device (`"1"`) | `lib/admin-access.ts` |
| `yfos:active-workout-draft:v1` | localStorage | **Single** in-progress active-workout draft (auto-saved). NOT history — separate from `yfos:workouts`; cleared on final save / explicit discard | `lib/active-workout-draft.ts` |
| `yfos:gym-visits:v1` | localStorage | Gym **attendance** history (`GymVisit[]`). Separate from `yfos:workouts` — being at the gym, not training. Each visit may carry an optional, additive `workouts?` display-only snapshot (no format/version change). Included in backups; cleared by `resetAll` | `lib/gym-attendance.ts` |
| `yfos:active-gym-visit:v1` | localStorage | **Single** open gym visit (`startedAt` only; the timer is derived). Closed into history on check-out, removed on discard. Included in backups; cleared by `resetAll` | `lib/gym-attendance.ts` |
| `yfos:personal-profile:v1` | localStorage | **Single** optional personal training profile (`TrainingProfile`: goal/location/frequency/experience/duration/equipment/notes + V2 optional `adaptation`/`age`/`heightCm`/`weightKg`/`trainingPreference`/`guidanceStyle` + `updatedAt`). Owned by `lib/personal-profile.ts` (own reactive layer + defensive parser). Included in backups (`personalProfile`, whole object — V2 fields additive); cleared by `resetAll` | `lib/personal-profile.ts` |
| `yfos:profile-onboarding-dismissed-session:v1` | **sessionStorage** | Profile-onboarding prompt dismissed **this session** (`"1"`) — V3 per-session gate; may re-show on a later entry while no profile exists. Gate/preference flag, **not** data — never backed up, **not** cleared by `resetAll`. Owned by `lib/profile-onboarding.ts` | `lib/profile-onboarding.ts` |
| `yfos:profile-onboarding-dismissed:v1` | localStorage | _Legacy_ permanent profile-prompt dismissed flag — retained, **no longer read** (superseded by the session key above in V3) | `lib/profile-onboarding.ts` |
| `yfos:backup-meta:v1` | localStorage | Backup bookkeeping only (`lastExportedAt` / `lastRestoredAt` / `lastRestoredBackupCreatedAt`). Best-effort status; **never** part of a backup and not "data" | `lib/backup.ts` |
| `yfos:water-goal-celebration-seen:v1` | localStorage | Anti-spam flag for the app-wide water-goal celebration (stores the last date it played). Isolated bookkeeping; **never** part of a backup and not "data". Re-armed when intake drops below the goal; cleared by `resetAll` | `lib/water-goal-events.ts` |

> The active-workout **draft** is intentionally outside `STORAGE_KEYS` and the
> history key (`yfos:workouts`): it is a recoverable in-progress slot, not a
> saved workout. See [`ACTIVE_WORKOUT_DRAFT_AUTOSAVE.md`](ACTIVE_WORKOUT_DRAFT_AUTOSAVE.md).
>
> The theme has **no separate key** — it is a field inside `yfos:settings`. The
> pre-paint `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT` reads `yfos:settings` directly. The three gates
> use pre-paint init scripts that toggle `.welcome-seen` /
> `.beta-welcome-seen` / `.admin-access-granted` on `<html>` so returning
> users never see a flash.

## 5. Reset behavior

| Action (Settings) | What it clears | What it preserves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reset all data** (`resetAll`) | All 9 `STORAGE_KEYS` data keys, incl. `yfos:settings` (theme returns to the default `light`), **plus** the gym keys (`yfos:gym-visits:v1`, `yfos:active-gym-visit:v1`) via `clearAllGymData()` **and** the personal profile (`yfos:personal-profile:v1`) via `clearPersonalProfile()` | All gate flags (`welcome-seen`, `beta-welcome-seen`, `admin-access`) — gates are not "data" |
| Reset personal profile (`clearPersonalProfile`) | `yfos:personal-profile:v1` only | All other modules |
| Reset saved food values | `yfos:saved-food-values:v1` only | Food logs, favorites |
| Reset favorite foods | `yfos:favorite-foods:v1` only | Food logs, saved values |
| Reset supplements | `yfos:supplements:v1` (deleting a supplement also drops its logs) | Other modules |
| Reset supplement log | `yfos:supplement-logs:v1` only | The supplement catalogue |
| Reset water day | One date inside `yfos:water-logs:v1` | All other days |
| Show welcome again (`resetWelcome`) | `yfos:welcome-seen:v1` only | All real data |
| Show beta notice again (`resetBetaWelcome`) | `yfos:beta-welcome-seen-session:v1` only (session flag) | All real data |
| Lock system — "נעל מערכת" (`resetAdminAccess`) | `yfos:admin-access-granted:v1` only — re-shows the access-code gate | All real data |

`resetAll` deliberately does **not** clear the gate flags, and the gate resets
deliberately do **not** touch user data. Keep these concerns separate.

## 6. Data domains

- **Workouts & templates** — `WorkoutSession`, `WorkoutTemplate` (`lib/fitness-types.ts`).
- **Exercises** — static seed of 133 items (`lib/seed-exercises.ts`); images under
  `public/exercises/`, optional verified YouTube demo links (`ExerciseVideo`).
- **Nutrition** — `FoodLog` entries; macros are **always user-entered**.
- **Food library** — static catalogue (`lib/food-library.ts`); images under `public/food/`.
- **Saved food values / favorites** — personal overlays keyed by `sourceFoodId`.
- **Water** — `WaterLog`/`WaterEntry`; `totalMl` is always recomputed from entries.
  Personal quick-add presets (`WaterPreset`) live in settings and default safely.
- **Supplements** — `Supplement` catalogue + `SupplementLog` taken-marks.
- **Settings** — `Settings` (theme, goals, water goal, water presets, protein calc inputs).
- **Knowledge** — static articles (`lib/knowledge-content.ts`) + protein calc (`lib/protein.ts`).

## 7. Architecture notes

- **Storage layer (`lib/storage.ts`)** is the *only* place that touches
  `localStorage` for app data. Everything is funneled through `readJSON`/`writeJSON`
  helpers that fail silently and are SSR-safe (`isBrowser()` guard).
- **Reactive layer (`lib/fitness-store.ts`)** wraps storage with
  `useSyncExternalStore`, caching snapshots and invalidating on mutation — no
  `setState`-in-effect, no hydration mismatch (server snapshots are stable
  constants; the real client value swaps in after mount).
- **Pure derivations (`lib/analytics.ts`, `lib/today.ts`,
  `lib/progress-insights.ts`)** never touch storage — callers pass data in, so they
  stay testable and SSR-safe. `lib/today.ts` adds the Today daily-completion +
  deterministic next-action logic; `lib/progress-insights.ts` adds the Progress
  weekly hero / insight cards / 7-day activity / personal records. Both are
  deterministic, no AI, no advice.
- **Gates (`lib/welcome.ts`, `lib/beta-welcome.ts`, `lib/admin-access.ts`)**
  mirror that same `useSyncExternalStore` shape and expose pre-paint init
  scripts. The admin gate fails **closed** (storage hiccup keeps it up); the
  other two fail open.
- **Theme (`components/ThemeProvider.tsx`)** supports only `light`/`dark` and
  toggles `.dark` on `<html>`; the saved value lives in settings. A legacy
  `theme: "system"` (or any unknown value) is sanitized to `light` on read
  (`sanitizeTheme` in `lib/storage.ts`) — never crashing, never re-persisting
  `system`, and matching the pre-paint `THEME_INIT_SCRIPT` so there is no flash.
- The `<head>` init scripts (theme + welcome + beta-welcome) run before paint to
  prevent flashes; `RootLayout` nests
  `BetaAuthGate → BetaWelcomeNotice → WelcomeGate → AppShell`.

## 8. Product boundaries — what must NOT be broken

- **No medical advice.** The app never diagnoses, prescribes, or recommends.
- **No supplement recommendations or dosages.** The supplements tracker only
  records what the user already decided to take; dosage text is free-form user
  input, never generated. Neutral category names only.
- **Nutrition values are user-entered only** — never inferred from images or
  external databases. Saved values and favorites never auto-fill macros.
- **Exercise videos are external demonstrations** (YouTube links, never embedded
  or hosted) — not medical or physical-therapy advice.
- **The Private Access Notice is informational only** — not authentication, no
  password, no backend check, no tracking. Fails open if storage is unavailable.
- **The Admin Access Code Gate is a client-side code gate** — not real auth, no
  backend check, no device detection, no tracking. The code lives in the bundle
  and is not a secret. Fails closed if storage is unavailable. See
  `docs/ADMIN_ACCESS_GATE.md`.
- **The Welcome screen is a first-visit intro** — not a gate that protects data.
- **No backend / auth / database / cloud sync / AI / external APIs** currently.
- Storage keys, exercise ids, exercise images, food data/images and supplement
  safety copy are stable contracts — do not change them in breaking ways.

## 9. Known future directions

- Optional Capacitor wrapper for a native Android/iOS build (no native code yet).
- Possible surfacing of structured data (templates, progress, knowledge, protein
  goal) inside a larger "Life OS" — data models are intentionally clean for this.
- `Exercise.videoUrl` and richer video metadata are reserved for future phases.
- **Personal Path / Smart Setup** — an optional future personal-setup flow. Not
  implemented; the System Hub shows a non-interactive "מסלול אישי · בקרוב" card
  as its placeholder entry point. No onboarding flow is forced now.

These are directions, **not** current scope — none of the hard boundaries in §8
change without an explicit new phase.

## 10. Optimization Audit Phase 1

- **Audit-only, no behaviour change.** Phase 1 of the System Optimization Audit ran
  on baseline commit `2830e40`. It produced a report
  ([`SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_PHASE_1.md`](SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_PHASE_1.md))
  and **did not** touch runtime code, UI/UX, schemas, storage keys, auth, backup,
  or data formats. Validation at baseline: `build` ✓, `lint` ✓ (0 errors, 1
  pre-existing QA-script warning), `test:e2e` ✓ (**100 passed**).
- **Headline findings:** **no P0/bug/safety issues.** Best safe wins (P1): extract a
  shared `CelebrationOverlay` primitive (3 overlays ~85% identical), extract
  `e2e/fixtures.ts` for duplicated test setup, and replace one `waitForTimeout` in
  `scroll-lock.spec.ts`. Medium (P2): `ModuleCard`/`OverlayDialog` consolidation and
  de-`force-dynamic`-ing the nutrition routes (`app/nutrition/page.tsx` reads the AI
  gate at request time). Deferred (P3, needs sign-off): the unmounted
  `AdminAccessCodeGate` / `PrivateAccessNotice` + their lib modules are confirmed
  dead but left in place.
- **Clarifications confirmed by the audit:** the nutrition photo AI is *feature-
  flagged*, not dead code (server-only key gate; UI shows "בקרוב" with no fetch when
  unconfigured); storage discipline is excellent (no raw `localStorage` in
  components except the pre-paint theme script); the `yuval-fit-os:`-prefixed
  guest-session key and the retained legacy access keys are intentional and must not
  be renamed.

## 11. Documentation map

Where to look, and in what order. **Start here, then the developer guide.**

- **Current source of truth**
  - **`PROJECT_STATE.md`** (this file) — always current; read first.
  - **`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`** — how to run, test, and extend.
  - **`README.md`** (repo root) — external intro; links to the two above.

- **Active product / feature docs** (`docs/`) — current per-feature specs:
  Today (`TODAY_QUICK_START`, `TODAY_COMMAND_CENTER_POLISH`, `TODAY_CLARITY_PASS`),
  Nutrition (`NUTRITION_CLARITY_PASS`, `NUTRITION_QUICK_REUSE`,
  `NUTRITION_FAVORITES`, `NUTRITION_SAVED_VALUES`, `NUTRITION_PHOTO_ASSIST`),
  Water (`WATER_TRACKING`, `WATER_PRESETS`, `WATER_GOAL_UX_UPGRADE`,
  `WATER_GOAL_GLOBAL_CELEBRATION`), Supplements (`SUPPLEMENTS_TRACKER`,
  `SUPPLEMENTS_LIBRARY_UX`, `SUPPLEMENT_TAKEN_CELEBRATION`),
  `PROTEIN_GOAL_CELEBRATION`, Workouts (`WORKOUTS_CLARITY_PASS`,
  `ACTIVE_WORKOUT_*`), `GYM_CHECK_IN`, `PROGRESS_INSIGHTS_UPGRADE`,
  `PERSONAL_PROFILE_V1`, `NAVIGATION_SYSTEM_HUB`, `SETTINGS_CONTROL_CENTER`,
  `BETA_WELCOME_NOTICE`, `PWA`, `UI_POLISH_PHASE_3_21_1`.

- **Technical / contract docs** — must stay accurate; some are referenced by code:
  `BACKUP_RESTORE` (export/import contract), `BETA_ACCESS_SYSTEM` (Supabase + RLS),
  `PRIVACY_TERMS_AI_DISCLAIMER` (legal pages), `ADMIN_ACCESS_GATE` (legacy gate),
  `EXERCISE_VIDEO_LINKS` (+ `EXERCISE_VIDEO_LINKS_AUDIT`),
  `EXERCISE_MEDIA_IMPORT` & `FOOD_MEDIA_IMPORT` (one-time import processes —
  still pointed at by `.gitignore` / `lib/food-library.ts`), `PHONE_INSTALL_QA`.

- **Optimization / audit docs** — the optimization trail:
  `SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_PHASE_1` (the audit), `SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_PHASE_2A`
  (CelebrationOverlay), `SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_PHASE_2B` (E2E fixtures),
  `SYSTEM_OPTIMIZATION_PHASE_2C` (this docs archive pass).

- **Archive** — [`docs/archive/`](archive/) holds superseded / removed-from-flow
  historical records (see [`archive/README.md`](archive/README.md)). These may be
  outdated and **do not override** `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
